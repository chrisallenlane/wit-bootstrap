wit-bootstrap
=============
This is an example blog built using [wit-cms][].

To use this boilerplate:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies (`npm i`)
3. Start the app (`node app.js`)
4. Get the feel for the example site in a browser
5. Start hacking code!

As a "hacking" starting point, you'll want to replace the content in the
`pages` and `posts` directories with your own content, making certain to
preserve the front-matter on each page/post. (You can modify the values, of
course.)

From there, "theming" may be accomplished by modifying the files in the `views`
and `public` directories.

`wit-bootstrap` is minimalist and un-opinionated, so you're free to continue
modifying from there without fear of breaking the `wit-cms` core.
