Welcome to `wit-bootstrap`!

`wit-bootstrap` is an example website built using
`wit-cms` - a flat-file, "blog aware", publishing platform
for nodejs. The fastest way to build a website based on
`wit-cms` is to clone this repository and modify the
the view templates. You'll also need - of course - to
replace these sample posts and pages with your own
content.

Before you delete these sample posts, though, you may want to take a moment to
skim through them. They contain some useful "getting started" information for
users that are new to `wit-cms`.

Happy blogging!
